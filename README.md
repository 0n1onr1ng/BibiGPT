# Todos v1

- [x] Make it work with edge functions and streaming instead of just serverless
- [x] Add loading logic and make summary look nicer by splitting into more paragraphs
- [ ] Add a footer
- [ ] Maybe summarize with bullet points? Maybe I should have a toggle that toggles between this
- [ ] Parse URL to make sure it includes techcrunch.com. new URL(string) - make sure it's valid and host name is techcrunch
- [ ] Make it work for featured articles â€“ why isn't it?

# Todos v2

- [ ] Add a "try one of these options": Add a try one of our links below (put 3 cards here)
- [ ] Maybe a slider for how long to make the summary
- [ ] Make sure to have clean URLs, remove query params
- [ ] Make them sharable links and cache with upstash redis
- [ ] TechCrunch-summarized.com, techcrunchTLDR, change one thing on techcrunch articles to get it summarized, can use [[...slug]].tsx
