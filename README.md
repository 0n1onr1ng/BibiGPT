# Todos

- [ ] Add loading logic and make summary look nicer
- [ ] Make it work with edge functions and streaming instead of just serverless
- [ ] Add a footer
- [ ] [Maybe] Make it work for featured articles â€“ why isn't it?
- [ ] Maybe summarize with bullet points? Maybe I should have a toggle that toggles between this
- [ ] Add a "try one of these options": Add a try one of our links below (put 3 cards here)

# Ideas

- TechCrunch-summarized.com, techcrunchTLDR, change one thing on techcrunch articles to get it summarized

// try to cache in upstash?
// check out the thing Steven did in /templates
// [[..slug]] is the path to the page?

Add a sharable link w/ OG image of article summarized

Maybe bullet points or split into smaller paragraphs
